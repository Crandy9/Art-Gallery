# Kaoru Art Gallery
This is a web application project I am building using the .NET framework.
This project implements .NET's Razor Pages web application programming model which is newer and more preferred over traditional MVC (so I've heard)

Users will be able to browse paintings, read about them, as well as purchase them. Secure payment API, user authorization and authentication will 
be employed.
