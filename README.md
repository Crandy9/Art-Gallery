# Kaoru Art Gallery
Published live on the Azure cloud. Check it out here+ https://kaoruartgallerywebapp.azurewebsites.net/
This is a web application project I am building using the .NET framework.
This project implements .NET's Razor Pages web application programming model which is newer and more preferred over traditional MVC (so I've heard)

Users will be able to browse paintings, read about them, as well as purchase them. Secure payment API, user authorization and authentication, and multi lingual page display will be employed soon. This is an ongoing project.
